This is the README file for Basic Joystick Input Device, a very simple and cool way of getting to know how a joystick works underneath the hood.

Further information about the Basic Joystick Input Device can be found in the project home page:

## Getting Started
This small project was developed with the only purpose in life of supporting a Technical Communication course presentation.

As so, and given the limited time available for the presentation, it is very simple to get it working.

### Prerequisites
* JVM (for the driver)
* Arduino Uno
* Joystick (duh.)
* Jumping Wires
